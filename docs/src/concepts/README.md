# Concepts

**TeraNUI** is a canvas-based UI framework designed to provide dynamic elements reflective of game state and adaptive to different resolutions.
The following sections concisely explain the central concepts of TeraNUI required to understand how it works and how it can be worked with.

> **Note:** More details on the presented concepts may be available but are not crucial for contributors interested in working _with_ TeraNUI only.

## Canvas

The _Canvas_ is the ground all NUI elements are drawn on - basically your screen.
It provides the primitive methods for rendering (drawing on it).
This allows for flexibility in the rendering technology and implementation utilized.


## Screen Layers

## Widgets

## Layouts
