# Flow Layout

The _Flow_ layout arranges its children in a directional flow that wraps at the layout's boundary,
very much like words wrap at the end of a line when writing a text. The children are layed out in
row in the flow direction, each widget sized by its preferred size. The individual elements are
top-aligned, and wrapped at the first element that does not fit in the row.

_Flow_ lays out each managed child regardless of the child's visible property value - invisible
children won't be rendered but will take up space. The layout may be styled as other widgets with
[Skins](). See [AbstractWidget]() superclass for more details.

Example of a _Flow_ layout:

```json
{
  "type": "FlowLayout",
  "verticalSpacing": 8,
  "horizontalSpacing": 24,
  "contents": [...]
  // all properties of AbstractWidget
}
```
