# TeraNUI: A Guide to Terasology's UI

"TeraNUI" is Terasology's New UI Framework - a canvas-based UI framework developed specifically with the needs of game UI in mind: dynamic elements reflective of game state and adaptive to different resolutions.
This guide covers the concepts of this framework and lists the individual layouts and widgets available for use.

For practical guidance on how to get started with TeraNUI and how to work with the TeraNUI in-game editor, please access the [TeraNUI tutorial](https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialNui/wiki).

For information on Terasology, please check out [the Terasology website](terasology.org) or [the main Terasology wiki](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki).
