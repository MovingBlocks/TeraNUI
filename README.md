## ðŸ¤“ Development

**Where do we do the main development?**
I guess a main branch with the latest code (on gestalt v7)...
 
**How do we maintain old versions?**
I assume there'll be a branch for TeraNUI v1 based on gestalt v5...

**How to back-port changes?** 
That's a question I'm always asking myself when submitting something to gestalt. I'd like to have a least a rough 
guideline how to backport a change to TeraNUI v1 so that every contributor with write permissions on this repo can do this.

- NUI is tied to a specific version of [gestalt]
- **v1.x** works with gestalt v5 (compatible with [Terasology])
- **v2.x** works with gestalt v7 (compatible with [DestinationSol])
- active development for v2 happens on the `master` branch
- maintenance of v1 happens the release branch `release/v1`
- changes and bug-fixes should be ported back to v1
    - create a new feature branch off the release branch to port the changes
    - cherry-pick the changes from the main branch to the feature branch
    - merge the feature branch back into the release branch


## ðŸš€ Release Management

A _release_ denotes that an artifact for the associated commit is available for consumption. Our
[Jenkins CI/CD pipeline][jenkins] automatically builds and publishes releases for the main `master` branch and release
branches prefixed with `release/{{version}}`. The artifact is published to our [Artifactory] under the version specified
in [`build.gradle`](./build.gradle).

> âš  **Note:** Whether an artifact should be published as release or snapshot is determined by whether or not there is a
> `-SNAPSHOT` in the version. Publishing will fail in case the same non-snapshot version is supposed to be published
> again.

The exact build steps for this library are defined in the [Jenkinsfile](./Jenkinsfile).
