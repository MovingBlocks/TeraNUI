# TeraNUI

**TeraNUI** (Terasology's New UI Framework) is a canvas based UI framework.

Its major features are:

- Canvas providing primitive draw operations for UI, including "drawing" interaction regions.
- Skins providing display information, handled through the canvas operations.
- UIWidget system for encapsulating drawing logic into objects
- Skin asset providing the ability to define skins
- UI asset providing the ability to define widget layouts
- Data binding support

## ðŸ¤– Maintenance

The main development of TeraNUI happens on the `master` branch, a strong main branch that always has the latest version
of the code. However, we maintain two versions of TeraNUI for [gestalt] v5 and v7, respectively. As the two code lines are nearly identical most changes to either version should be [ported back ðŸ”—](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops#port-changes-back-to-the-main-branch) to the other. 
 

| Branch         | Version | gestalt | Projects |
| -------------- |:-------:|:-------:| -------- |
| `master`       | v2.x    | v7      | [DestinationSol] |
| `release/v1.x` | v1.x    | v5      | [Terasology]

Porting changes from one branch to the other should be possible by _cherry picking_ the respective commits as there are
no differences in the code (yet). **Make sure to adjust the version number to the respective branch when porting a change.**

## ðŸš€ Release Management

A _release_ denotes that an artifact for the associated commit is available for consumption. Our
[Jenkins CI/CD pipeline][jenkins] automatically builds and publishes releases for the main `master` branch and release
branches prefixed with `release/v{{major-version}}.x`. The artifact is published to our [Artifactory] under the version specified
in [`build.gradle`](./build.gradle).

> âš  **Note:** Whether an artifact should be published as release or snapshot is determined by whether or not there is a
> `-SNAPSHOT` in the version. Publishing will fail in case publishing the same non-snapshot version is attempted
> again.

The exact build steps for this library are defined in the [Jenkinsfile](./Jenkinsfile).

### Release Process

As releases are automatically triggered from `master` and `release/v{{major-version}}.x` the required steps to make a 
non-snapshot release for any version is as follows:

1. **Decide on release version** â–ª Which branch to publish, under which version?

    _The version number MUST be a higher SemVer than the current version of the branch to release.
     The version bump SHOULD follow SemVer specifications, e.g., increase the major version for breaking changes, or do
     a patch release for bug fixes._
 
1. **Make the release commit** â–ª Trigger a release via [Jenkins]

    _Update the version in [build.gradle](./build.gradle) and remove the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix. Commit the change with the
     following message:_

    > `release: version {{version}}`

    _Until we have automatic tagging or a tag-based release process it is recommended to manually
     [create and push an annotated tag][git-tag] for the respective version on `master`. For a library release v1.2.3
     the tag process is:_
    
    ```sh
    git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3"
    git push --tags
    ```
    
1. **Prepare for next release** â–ª Bump to next snapshot version

    _Finally, we have to increase the version number to be able to get pre-release `-SNAPSHOT` builds for subsequent 
     commits. Therefore, the version number MUST be a higher SemVer than the version just released. This will typically
     be a minor version bump. To do this, just update the version in [build.gradle](./build.gradle) and commit the 
     change with the following message:_
    
    > `chore: prepare next snapshot for {{version}}`


> ðŸ’š We try to keep v1 and v2 in sync, thus this relase process should usually be executed for both branches,
> respectively.
